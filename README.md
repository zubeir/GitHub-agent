# GitHub-agent

This repository is for the GitHub agent, which leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a specification for structuring, exchanging, and managing context between AI models, agents, and tools. It enables seamless interoperability and context sharing, improving the effectiveness and safety of AI-driven workflows.

### Key Concepts
- **Context Envelope:** Standardized structure for passing context (user, task, history, environment, etc.)
- **Serialization:** Defines how context is encoded (e.g., JSON, YAML)
- **Versioning:** Supports protocol evolution and backward compatibility
- **Security:** Guidelines for sensitive data handling and access control
- **Extensibility:** Allows custom fields and domain-specific extensions

### Example Context Envelope
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "user": {
    "id": "user-123",
    "roles": ["developer"]
  },
  "task": {
    "id": "task-456",
    "description": "Create a new repository and add a README"
  },
  "history": [
    {"event": "repo_created", "timestamp": "2025-06-13T15:58:12Z"}
  ],
  "environment": {
    "platform": "GitHub",
    "repo": "GitHub-agent"
  }
}
```
